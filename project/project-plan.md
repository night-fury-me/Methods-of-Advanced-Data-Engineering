## Title

Influence of Solar Activity on Earth's Climate: Deciphering the Patterns

## Main Question

What is the relationship between solar activity and climate change on Earth?

## Description

_Understanding the correlation between solar activity and climate change is crucial for comprehending the drivers behind Earth's climate variability. This project aims to analyze various aspects of solar activity, such as - sunspot numbers, solar flares, and investigate their potential impact on climate change on Earth. By employing data science techniques, we seek to uncover any significant correlations or causal relationships between solar phenomena and changes in Earth's climate. The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions between the Sun and Earth's climate system, potentially informing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies._
